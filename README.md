"Kittens engage in play during most of their waking moments, and explaining why they do so is not straightforward... The simplest explanation for why kittens feel they ought to play, and why they continue to play even following a slight mishap, is that play is _fun_."

â€” J. Bradshaw, _Cat Sense_, Chapter 6: Thoughts and Feelings.
